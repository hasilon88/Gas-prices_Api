## GasBuddy Gas Price API: *Access Real-Time Gas Prices with Flask*

Welcome to the GasBuddy Gas Price API! üöóüí® This project contains a script that scrapes gas prices from a website and makes them available through a Flask server.

### Overview

The Gas Prices API retrieves gas price data from a website and exposes it through a Flask server. It allows users to access the top 10 cheapest gas prices for any city in North America at any given time.

### How to Use

**Option 1: Local Deployment**

1. Clone this repository and start a Flask server.
2. Modify the URL in any browser as follows:
```
  http://www.localhost:8000/{province}/{city}
```

**Option 2: Remote Deployment**

- Access the API using the following URL and modify it for your needs:
```
https://gas-prices-api.vercel.app/{province}/{city}
```

### Endpoints

- **Landing Page**: Visit the root URL to get started. It provides instructions on how to use the API.

- **Get Gas Prices**: Use the endpoint `/province/city` to fetch gas price information for a specific province and city.

### Example

### Return Structure

The API returns a JSON object containing gas station information including:

- **Station Name**
